        <h2>What is WeeB?</h2>
        <p>WeeB (proper name WeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeBasic) is an <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esoteric programming language</a> invented by <a href="https://github.com/none-None1">None1</a>, you can see the original specification at the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/WeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeBasic">Esolang wiki</a>.<br>
        WeeB is a derivative of the esoteric programming language <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</a>. It adds BASIC-like syntax, including if statements, while loops and string printing, making it high level. <br>
        And it removes some bad commands in Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, such as the useless forward jump command and the program start and termination commands. A later Turing-complete derivative <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/WeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeBasic++">WeeB++</a> (a.k.a WeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeBasic++), expands memory <br>
        to a tape and a pointer, and adds some extra commands and some changes on the original commands.</p>
